    "#### Producing triangle plots\n",
    "[Triangle or ternary plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot) provide a means to visualize membership strength. For the purposes of the Kreek data, the triangle plots are used to determine how similar self-reports of individuals from a Kreek ancestry group are to three disparate reference populations. The visualizations allow for the identification of potential outliers that would be removed from downstream processing and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: The command line Perl script below assumes a specific order of the STRUCTURE output data in regards to the group IDs. Modifications should be made as necessary to ensure that the labels match with the ID. Additionally, `triangle_plot.R` does not check that the cluster specifications match the given 1000G superpopulation labels. Be sure to assign the right label to the right group ID from previous processing steps."

    "Linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning eliminates a large degree of redundancy in the data and reduces the influence of chromosomal artifacts. The objective of LD pruning is to select a subset of variants based off of LD such that the variants in the subset are independent. This filtering will not carry forward to the final processed results, but this step improves the quality of identity-by-state (IBS) and identity-by-descent (IBD) calculations. Consequently, the LD pruned data will be used as input into IBS and IBD calculations.\n",

Identical-by-descent or identity-by-descent allows for detection of high relatedness. For computational efficiency and memory usage limitations, ibd_pipeline.v4.sh is used to perform IBS/IBD calculations on data chunks that are used as input for IBS and IBD filtering.

Removal criteria is based on genotype calling rate. These individuals would need to be removed before running IBD filtering and KING. Graph analysis would need to be run after IBD calculations/KING if individuals were selected for removal."

    "## Recoding variants for 1000G phase 3\n",
    "RefSeq IDs (rsIDs) for variants can vary depending on the dbSNP build used and variant IDs do not all use RefSeq nomenclature. To provide a common nomenclature that will make comparisons across data sets feasible, I use a script that recodes all variant names to match 1000G phase 3 variants by position and alleles. The 1000G Phase 3 data I used for STRUCTURE are from /share/nas03/bioinformatics_group/data/ref_panels/1000G/2013.05/plink on MIDAS, but from correspondence with Nathan Gaddis I learned that /share/nas03/bioinformatics_group/data/ref_panels/1000G/2014.10/ also contains 1000G Phase 3 data derived from the May 2013 release. The difference is that it was downloaded from the IMPUTE2 website and reformatted to be directly compatible with IMPUTE2.\n",

    "Because the 1000G data and the study data have RefSeq IDs (rsIDs) from different dbSNP builds, I standardize them using convert_to_1000g_ids.pl. In the study data set, certain indels may be represented as two variants, a monomorphic variant and an indel with the - symbol for one of the alleles. For example:\n",

    "These two variants represent a G:GA indel and is coded as such in the 1000 Genomes data. The script to update the names to 1000 Genomes IMPUTE2 format will assign the same ID to these two variants. The duplicated IDs will cause problems for PLINK filtering, so I will remove the variant from a set of duplicate IDs that has the lower genotype call rate. Duplicates may arise for other reasons, and they will be filtered based on the same criterion."
