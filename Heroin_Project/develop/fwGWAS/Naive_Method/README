This directory contains 3 files: 
1. a methods file
2. a run-meth file
3. and a jupyter notebook of the methods file

The methods file is a pipeline developed to run the
naive method for fwGWAS. The pipeline is a python 
script that is automated to run the naive method
from start to finish by simply adjusting a few
parameters (paths, filenames). This script was written 
with reusability in mind. Specifically, we have
modularized the code into 7 functions that can be used
as standalone functions.

The run_methods file is simply a short bash script to 
submit the methods file pipeline to the job scheduler.

The jupyter notebook also contains the pipeline constituent
functions, only with a bit more annotation and comments.
