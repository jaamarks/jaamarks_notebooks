To run the Naive method in this directory:
1. modify four variables in the methods file to specify 
   the paths and names of GWAS results and processing dir.
2. type the command <bash run-meth.sh> to run the methods file.
	- the results current working directory should match
	  the processing directory specified in the methods file.


This directory contains 3 files: 
* a methods file (_methods-fwgwas-naive-scz2-20180911.py)
* a run methods file (run-meth.sh)
* and a jupyter notebook detailing the methods file (fwGWAS-naive-method-20180911.ipynb)

The methods file is a pipeline developed to run the
naive method for fwGWAS. The pipeline is a python3 
script that is automated to run the naive method,
from start to finish, by simply modifying four 
variables (paths, filenames). This script was written 
with reusability in mind. Specifically, we have
modularized the code into 7 functions that can be used
as standalone functions.

The run methods file is simply a short bash script to 
submit the methods file pipeline to the job scheduler.
Again note that the present working directory should be 
same as the processing directory specified in the methods
file.

The jupyter notebook also contains the pipeline constituent
functions, only with a bit more annotation and comments.
