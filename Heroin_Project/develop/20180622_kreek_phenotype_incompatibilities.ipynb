    "# Kreek phenotype inconsistencies - dbGaP Study Accession phs001109.v1.p1\n",
    "**Author**: Jesse Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "There appeared to be some inconsistencies observed between the [Online Variable Report](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/dataset.cgi?study_id=phs001109.v1.p1&phv=261892&phd=6837&pha=&pht=5447&phvf=1&phdf=&phaf=&phtf=1&dssp=1&consent=&temp=1) on the dbGaP web page and the actual phenotype files downloaded from the authorized access page. These inconsistencies were found while working on a GWAS of the Kreek data with the phenotype of interest being \"opioid dependence\". The phenotype data were downloaded on `June 22, 2018` and the dbGaP Online Variable Report was accessed on the same date. This document will detail the inconsistencies found."
