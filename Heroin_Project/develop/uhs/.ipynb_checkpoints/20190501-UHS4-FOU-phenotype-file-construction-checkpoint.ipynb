    "# UHS4 Phenotype File Construction: Map genotype ids to phenotype ids\n",
    "**Author**: Jesse Marks\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents the steps taken to link the UHS4 genotype data to the phenotype data.  The phenotype data have been compiled into a master file constructed by Bryan Quach. The linkage from genotype IDs to the phenotype file is not straightforward. For this reason, a custom Python module was developed to link the genotype IDs to there respective phenotypes. The individual IDs are made up of different portions (e.g. AS00-00347_8002022294_HHG10078_12_H06). Some of the IDs we might be able to map to the phenotype file by the cell_line portion (e.g. HHG10078), then other times we might have to try to map to the phenotype file using the serum ID portion of the genotype ID (e.g. AS00-00347). The follow script does this searching for us. \n",
