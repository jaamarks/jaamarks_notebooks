    "### Linkage disequilibrium pruning\n",
    "Linkage disequilibrium (LD) pruning eliminates a large degree of redundancy in the data and reduces the influence of chromosomal artifacts. The objective of LD pruning is to select a subset of variants based off of LD such that the variants in the subset are independent. This filtering will not carry forward to the final processed results, but this step improves the quality of identity-by-state (IBS) and identity-by-descent (IBD) calculations. Consequently, the LD pruned data will be used as input into IBS and IBD calculations.\n",

    "LD pruning is implemented using [PLINK --indep-pairwise](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/ld#indep)."

    "Identical-by-state or identity-by-state (IBS) filtering provides a means to identify duplicate subjects or monozygotic twins. Identical-by-descent or identity-by-descent allows for detection of high relatedness. For computational efficiency and memory usage limitations, ibd_pipeline.v4.sh is used to perform IBS/IBD calculations on data chunks that are used as input for IBS and IBD filtering. If the study contains AA subjects, then for AA subjects only, [KING](http://people.virginia.edu/~wc9c/KING/manual.html) is used as an additional relationship inference tool for filtering.\n",

Following IBS filtering, if any individuals are identified for removal, a graph analysis needs to be done to account for an individual being related/identical to multiple individuals. Removal criteria is based on genotype calling rate. These individuals would need to be removed before running IBD filtering and KING. Graph analysis would need to be run after IBD calculations/KING if individuals were selected for removal."
