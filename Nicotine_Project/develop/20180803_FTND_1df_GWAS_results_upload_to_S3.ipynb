    "# FTND Data Upload\n",

    "This notebook will be documenting the steps I have taken to upload our latest FTND 1df individual cohort GWAS results to AWS S3 in an effort to make sure all of our latest results are stored in the cloud. This was prompted when I was experiencing hardware issues while working with and on the share:drive on 20180803. Specifically, I attempted to download from MIDAS the processed GWAS results for the decode data set and found I was unable to view them on the share:drive, for some reason unbeknownst to me. This is not the first instance of hardware malfunctioning I have experienced while using the share:drive. For example, often times (maybe every time) I have uploaded something new to the share:drive, my colleagues are unable to view the new upload. I end up having to send the file to my colleagues via a OneDrive link attached to an email. In any case, working with the share:drive has been quite a hassle for me. It would be very convenient if I was not experiencing these malfunctions. I don't trust the share:drive and believe that we need a back up. For this reason, I have taken the liberty to upload our latest set of individual cohort results to AWS S3 and synthesize this knowledge in an Excel spreadsheet. \n",
