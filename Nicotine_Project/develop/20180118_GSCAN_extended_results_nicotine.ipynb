    "With the merge.R script, we merge the results from the missing SNP look-up. This script needs to be modified to match the corresponding results files from each meta-analysis. Then, you can start an R session and paste the contents of the `merge.R` file into the R environment. Lastly, you will write the results to a table as shown below. With the tables that are created, you can then combine them into one excel notebook with 3 different sheets, in this case."
