The [eMERGE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/cgi-bin/study.cgi?study_id=phs000360.v1.p1) Network is a consortium of five participating sites (Group Health Seattle, Marshfield Clinic, Mayo Clinic, Northwestern University, and Vanderbilt University). We will be processing the Marshfield cohort.\n",

    "* we have 1000 Genomes phase 3 imputation already available on the full COPDGene dataset\n",
    "* double-check that there are no duplicate individuals between our existing COPDGene1 GWAS (current smokers only) and this new COPDGene2 dataset (mostly former smokers, but some current smokers embedded). If there is duplication, drop them from COPDGene2.\n",
    "* we will run COPDGene1 and COPDGene2 separately because FTND was collected several years apart and there were some key differences in the way that the questions were asked in the different waves. We will keep the two waves separate to circumvent any potential discrepancies which could arrise because of the phenotypes being less than harmonious and then we will combine them in a meta-analysis later. \n",
    "* There will be ~2900 with FTND data collected in wave 2 but NOT in wave 1 - these are the ones to be inclused in the new COPDGene2 GWAS (N=2610 EAs and 290 AAs).\n",

Now we know that subjects with an indeterminant status (i.e. finalGold=-1) were subjects that were classified to be between case and control. With this newfound knowledge, we can go ahead and include these subjects and rerun COPDGene1 with these subjects plus the subjects that were in the previous analysis. The model will be:\n",
