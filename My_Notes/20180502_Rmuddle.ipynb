    "R offers a wide variety of statistical capabilities and visualizations. With over 12450 packages, a dynamic dashboarding tool in R-Shiny, and a growing community of R-users, R is increasingly becoming a popular choice for new and experienced programmers. Regardless of your statistical background, programming capabilities, or love for expensive programs such as SAS or Stata, this Muddle will offer a quick dive into how R is being used at RTI and the advantages this open-source software has over its competitors. We will spend time focusing on how to get started with R, the capabilities of the software that are already being used at RTI, and provide a quick demo of how Râ€™s visualization offerings are truly limitless with the progression of the htmlwidgets package."
