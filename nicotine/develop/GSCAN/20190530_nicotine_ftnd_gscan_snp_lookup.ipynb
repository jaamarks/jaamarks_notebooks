    "I need to create a dictionary of the GSCAN SNPs and then see if each SNP in the meta-analysis is in the dictionary. I think this makes more sense rather than vice-versa; in particular, creating a dictionary for each SNP in the meta-analysis and then searching to see if the GSCAN SNPs are in the dictionary. This latter strategy would require a large amount of memory to create the Python dictionary. The former strategy makes more sense when comsidering computation expense. \n",

I think the reason is that these SNPs of the former format did not have an associated rsID available. If a GSCAN SNP is not found in the lookup, then we need to output the SNPs that were not found and deal with those later. It might be the case that we have to convert them from `rsid:position:a1:a2` format to `chr:position:a1:a2` and then perform the search again with just these SNPs."
