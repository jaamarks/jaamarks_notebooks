    "# SNP lookup\n",

    "This document was created in an effort to reaffirm the validity of our FTND meta-analysis pipeline (see email thread initiated by Dana Hancock on 20180802 with the subject titled \"RE: EUR-specific ND meta file with cohort results\"). We will use the EA-specific results to perform this sanity check. Specifically, we will perform a SNP lookup in the individual EA-cohorts and compare the betas and p-values with the meta-analysis results to make sure there is concordance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our current meta-analysis implements the METAL software. The AA-specific meta-analysis carried out with METAL outputted the meta-analysis results with the cohort-specific data appended. The EA-specific meta-analysis was also carried out with METAL, however, the cohort-specific data was NOT appended. We are not sure why these results were not appended but one theory is that maybe METAL has a output-file size limit on the meta-analysis results. Afterall, there were more EA-specific cohorts than AA-specific cohorts. In any case, we will have to perform a SNP lookup manually in the EA-specific GWAS results and append those results to the meta-analysis results outputted by METAL. After discussion with Dana Hancock, it will suffice to perform the SNP look-up on the top 1000 SNPs. This will allow us to ascertain the general trend and tell if the meta-analysis results are copacetic. Note, we were able to verify the validity of the AA-specific results and in another recent meta-analysis implementing the METAL software so really this is a quote unquote triple-check. "
